> Product lifecycles, waste management, and the impact of non-recyclable materials on garbage accumulation and disposal.

#
#### Product Lifecycles

The majority of companies that produce products to sell aren't legally responsible for maintaining a closed product lifecycle. When a product is expended, then it's disposed of in the local town or city. Public services are created and held responsible for collecting and managing garbage that's accumulated from other places. Amazon can sell products that other companies produce because the companies don't collect their product garbage and don't maintain a closed product lifecycle.

#### Closed Product Lifecycles

Closed product lifecycles aren't always possible because as some companies grow, they stop producing their products, change materials, or change their business operations. Some products have to be single-use, like medication containers, food packaging, glass, pressure tanks, and consumer electronics. Returning product garbage to the original producer of a product might not always be possible because of the consumer's decisions, product scarcity, and product value.

#### Garbage Problems and Solutions

A lot of garbage is burned for energy or buried in landfills. Some landfills contaminate the surrounding soil and water. Product garbage that isn't burned or buried, like old car tires, is recycled by recycling companies. Recycling companies are created to work with public services and manage garbage.

1. Legally restricting companies from using non-recyclable materials to produce their products would eliminate the accumulation and public management of product garbage. This restriction would also limit the available materials for companies to use in production, and then this limits our consumer lifestyle.

2. Waste management and product garbage do employ some people but not a lot. Automation will help replace people working for public and private waste management companies.

#### Ecofriendly

The rapid evolution of product development throughout the past century in sectors like healthcare, medicine, and technology were and continue to be produced using non-recyclable materials. A lot of people wouldn't have been able to live or been supported to live without the use of non-recyclable materials. Supporting the current standards of living without producing products using non-recyclable materials would be very uncomfortable and might not be possible.

### Presorted Waste Collection

#### Garbage Presorting Machine

*"Within this context, Mattiussi Ecologia is asking young eco-friendly designers to envisage the future of presorting household waste in the home, in order to improve its perception among residents and their
propensity to do it, as well as support its effectiveness. Imagining the home of the future, with sustainability and technology in settings where space is increasingly limited, the aim is to design a new product for home living able to combine design, functionality and sustainability as well as digital technology."*

Mattiussi Ecologia is basically seeking innovative designers to envision a garbage sorting machine for households, aiming to enhance waste sorting habits and efficiency while considering limited space and technological advancements. The goal is to create a product that merges design, functionality, sustainability, and digital technology, making waste sorting easier and more appealing for residents in future homes.

#### Garbage Presorting Difficulties

Presorting garbage for curbside collection presents a formidable challenge for both everyday individuals and businesses, adding an extra task to their already demanding routines. This additional responsibility demands time and effort from residents and employees alike, as they must carefully segregate various waste categories such as recyclables, organic matter, and hazardous materials. However, without the provision of sorted curbside garbage collection services, this task becomes even more burdensome. The lack of a segregated collection system not only complicates waste management but also imposes significant logistical and financial strains on households and businesses. Moreover, the absence of such services hampers environmental conservation efforts, as recyclable materials frequently end up in landfills, contributing to pollution and resource depletion. Therefore, the absence of sorted curbside garbage collection not only adds to the workload of everyday people and businesses but also impedes progress toward achieving sustainable waste management practices.

Changing how a product is consumed, like pouring a takeout coffee into an insulated mug, is very smart. Businesses and brands sell a lot of products to consumers that are created to be sold and disposed. Most businesses and brands aren't legally responsible for maintaining a closed product lifecycle which leaves the consumer and governments responsible for managing the garbage. This way of consuming isn't taught in schools or supported by consumer goods industries that have open product lifecycles.
